(1, 'Way shorter than I was expecting, it arrived so dirty like someone had stepped all over it, it wasn\'t even packaged correctly it was open on one side and had a rubber band wrapped around it. So disappointed'),
(2, 'I\'m 6\'4\'\' and about 260 and usually wear a 2xlT. So I went with the 3xl. It\'s pretty comfortable but just a little too short unfortunately. Sleeve length is good but the torso length just doesn\'t do it for me. Overall not bad.'),
(3, 'Great hoodie, light weight, I am a 5\'9 , 250lbs female. I like things a little bigger, not snug. The mens 3xl, which I always wear a womans 3xl top, fits perfect. Not snug, not too baggy. Just right. Females who wear a 2xl-3xl I suggest 3xl. Go up to 4 if you want it baggy. As far as men. My fiance has broad shoulders and a Santa belly, he usually wears a 3xl, 5\'8 255, and this fit him snuggly so he would go 4xl..front pocketss go thru, not seperated. Great price, great quality, cotton so I\'d hang dry to avoid shrinkage and once dry throw it in dryer to soften and dewrinkle. Packaged well, arrived next day! Would definitely reccommened.'),
(4, 'Shocked by how wonderful this hoodie is. It\'s a bit thinner than most but it fits perfectly in the arms and torso (maybe the tiniest bit baggy in the sleeves but otherwise a very well-fitting garment). Also a total bargain given the price. I\'m off to order some more in different colors. Run--don\'t walk-- to this hoodie!Will update this review for durability in the future.'),
(5, 'I am always hesitant on buying clothes and such from online especially since I am a plus size. I will say I got the XL and washed it soon as I got it and it still fits amazing. Some say order two sizes up if I would have done that I would have drowned in it. I am 5\'3 255 pounds ( Which all weights look different and are portioned different) I always recommend a size up, but I am glad that I stuck to my normal men size on this one.  The inside is super soft and all around very comfy. Well worth the buy. I will be getting another one!'),
(6, 'I am a woman. I purchased this hoodie because I had been looking for a reasonably priced, plain black hoodie for months with no luck. It seems that women\'s clothing are far more expensive than men\'s clothing, even though they\'re often made with less material (and, in many cases, lower quality material). But I digress....I believe I went one or two sizes down and it fit me well. A little baggy, just how I like it.This hoodie is okay. It\'s nothing spectacular—plain like I wanted it to be.There are several reasons why I\'m giving it only three stars. It\'s soft when you first get it, but it loses that softness after a couple washes. It also fades in the wash, even if you follow the instructions on the care label.Overall, it served it\'s purpose and I think I only paid $11 for an X-Large, so I\'m not too upset about it.'),
(7, 'Overall, this hoodie was a very good buy.  Bought this flannel top to go with flannel sweatpants of same color and quality.  The quality is very good, and I fully intend to purchase more hoodies soon.The one caution I would have is for anyone whose head is XXL!  The XL size for me fit just right. However, the hood\'sneck is a bit of a close fit.  Should the neck cut have been more elastic,  I would have given five stars.Bottom Line - this is a fit for most L and XL\'s.'),
(8, 'This is such a great hoodie! I was worried it would be too thin but it isn\'t! It\'s not super thick but it does get really toasty. The material is so comfortable and soft. The sleeves are a little long on me but I like it that way. I was worried the hood would be too pointed but it\'s not too bad, though it is a little pointed. The hood is also really big. Like it sometimes falls completely over my face, but it\'s not a problem if you just wear it on the edgeEssentially I love this hoodie so much and I\'m going to wear it all the timeIt might wear out faster since it was only $10, but if it wears out I\'ll just buy a new one since it was only $10, ya feel me?The pics are bad quality, sorryThe second pic is an example of the hood pulled all the way over for size reference, and the first pic is how I wear the hood'),
(9, 'I bought a few of these and one I gave one  to my Husband for work but unfortunately it\'s not thick enough.Normally I buy Carhartt which is much thicker and better quality but I thought this would be ok just to work in but it\'s not.My Husband is an Electrian and has to take a Ferry every week to get there.The true test was on the Ferry and he said that it wasn\'t warm enough so there is know way he would wear this on any outside job even with layers.I gave them to my Son\'s and they just wear them around the house but there not bad I just wouldn\'t recommend these for Winter but of course that depends where you live.They fit seems right but im sticking with Carhartt for my Husband.'),
(10, 'I was indecisive on what size to get and I went through all of the questions and reviews to see if anyone who was similar to me provided any helpful info. No one did. So I hope this helps someone. I\'m a 5\'5\' 200lb woman, carry my weight in chest and hips. Ordered XXL because I like my hoodies roomy. It was a just a little roomier than I would have liked, but it shrunk a little bit when I laundered it, so now it\'s perfect. The sleeves are a little long, but not cumbersome. The bottom band hugs my hips not too loose, not too tight. It\'s very soft, lightweight, and warm. I would have given five stars, but I noticed it has a hole in the seam at the cuff and now I have to return it, which is adds a little chore to my to-do list.'),
(11, 'This sweater is super soft! Wasn\'t too expensive. Actually fit me. I\'m 5\'2 and I got the small size and it fit just right. Shipping took a little though, so don\'t expect to get the item quickly.'),

(14, 'It was a perfect fit!I very much recommend this hoodie. It is nice and soft,it had a smell at first but it will go away. I\'m a female ,5\'7 ft,and 127pounds and I got the medium size.'),
(15, 'Just received the hoodie in the mail. Sleeve length is great, I also love the cuffs on the sleeves, very snug on my wrists which I like. The width of the hoodie in the body is also really nice (large size). What I\'m not so fond of is the length of the body of the hoodie. It\'s a little to short, and I\'m assuming it will shrink up a bit as well, so I\'m afraid it won\'t fit very well once I wash it. But as of right now, it does fit pretty well and has good warmth!'),
(16, 'Used it for an E.T. sort of costume, fits good and quality is OK for the price'),
(17, 'I\'m a girl, 5 foot 2 and I weigh 110 pounds. I got a small, it\'s pretty big on me, I feel like it makes my shoulders look big lol because of the way it is but I suppose on a guy the shoulder room would be a plus. It\'s really comfortable, great soft warm fabric, nice pocket in the middle, pretty bright vivid royal blue, I wear it to work at my warehouse job, it\'s warm, comfy and it holds my cell phone well. I love it! I won\'t order another one because I was hoping it would be smaller but I\'m not surprised since this is for men. I like it though. The hood is insanely big but that\'s not a bad thing. It you got a white hoodie you might look like a clansmen lmfao'),
(18, 'This is EXACTLY what I look for EVERY fall/winter with no luck. Who knew I should have been checking the men\'s section? Anyway, I am 5\'11\', 235lbs, usually wear size 16 bottoms and about size 10-12 tops and have a 36GG bra size. I ordered the medium, and while it IS snug over my chest, it is still just the perfect balance of comfort and style. My figure doesn\'t get lost under this hoodie, but I can still wear it with no shapewear and be super comfortable. I recommend this hoodie to EVERYONE!'),
(19, 'Great Fit! Nice warm hoody. I\'m 6\'4\' 250lbs XXL fit perfect on me. Little shrinkage but still fits great. Whoever buys this hoody tell your height weight so you can help others who may be the same figure as you.'),
(20, 'Was hoping it would be bigger, but still great!'),
(21, 'Bought it as an oversized hoodie. I got an XL in the color Gold. I am normally a size Medium & sometimes a Small. The pointed hood is kind of creepy. It fit as expected for an oversized look, but the sleeves were way too long, so I just folded them up. It\'s comfortable, and perfect for chilly days or cold classrooms. I added rose patches for a trendy look, which I also ordered from amazon.'),
(22, 'I really wanted to love this sweatshirt based on the weight of it, softness, and value.  Unfortunately I\'m a bigger guy 6\'1 @ 240.  I like my hoodies to fit loose so I buy up one size ( 3x in hoodie and I\'m a 2x in most everything else ) ...  What I noticed with Hanes is they only seem to increase the body of the hoodie , the arms and hood itself seem to be \' standard \' sizing ... So what you get is a good good fit in the body but arms that are too tight and short and a hood that is tight in the neck and so small it looks ridiculous , half my head is still sticking out ... ( I returned my Hanes \' nano \' hoodie for the same reason ...  Hey Hanes , big guys are often big all around ... Were not all little guys with beer bellies. I\'m sure the sharing of sleeves and hoods works for Medium to Large but it\'s a failure going Medium to 3x ... The two most correctly proportion brands for me are Russell and Gildan...'),
(23, 'This hoodie srunk 2 sizes when washed in cold water...seller would not help with refund or replacement'),
(24, 'Waste of money. The upper part of the hoodie fit fine. However, the waist line was too short and felt awkward. On top of that, after one wash the color faded. I just gave up after that....smh.  I have purchased Hanes products before and never experienced this. I was unable to send back because I did not open until after the option to return was up. I dont recommend item. The sweat pants was even worse ....'),
(25, 'I bought 2 of these and they did the same thing. They fit fine then I washed them. Totally ruined them. Shrunk unevenly so now looks like I have a belly shirt.'),
(26, 'Not the color I expected...'),
(27, 'I am 5\'1 and 98 lbs. I usually fit a womens small or x-small.The hoodie fit just as expected. I ordered a mens small black hoodie and the hoodie is slightly oversized (which I wanted) but not to the point of giant. There is plenty of room in the hoodie, and its length reaches a little past 1/3 my thigh.Though the outside isn\'t as soft, the inside is very soft and lined with fleece, making it very warm. Because of the fleece, be aware that some shirt fabrics will catch the fleece and lint/fuzzballs(?).Shipping is also incredibly fast. I didn\'t pay for expedited or two-day shipping, yet I got this hoodie in two days. The staff was also quick at responding to my emails in a timely fashion.Get it while it\'s on sale right now for a good price. I\'m thinking about buying other colors in the future, and I already ordered the white one.'),
(28, 'Okay, I wear Women\'s XS, or size 0-2. There is no way that a Men\'s small would fit me, but surprisingly this one does! I think the name \'Men\'s pullover\' is misleading because it\'s not men\'s size.Few downsides, like others mentioned, are that he sleeves around wrists and waist are tight (not that flexible). I think I would order Medium if I need a second hoodie. I want a little more roomy feel, and me wearing men\'s Medium is kind of crazy. Again, the size is tricky, so you need to be careful!I give five-star despite the confusing size and inflexibility of the sleeve, because of the price I paid for it. Good basic hoodie.'),
(29, 'I got this sweatshirt in a size 5x, because I want an inexpensive one that I can just throw on OVER ANYTHING, and not particularly care if it gets filthy or messed up.  (I typically wear a 3x) For that purpose, this Hanes hoodie is fine. It\'s not quite as big as I expected - in fact, I also got an Amazon branded 4x at the same time, and the Amazon branded sweatshirt is bigger than this Hanes 5x. Does Hanes run smallish, or Amazon run big?  I can\'t say for sure.In general, it just doesn\'t quite seem to fit right - but then, it shouldn\'t - it\'s two sizes too big on purpose! But the Amazon branded hoodie feels like it is proportioned better, just way too big - which is kind of what I wanted from this Hanes hoodie.  Take this comment with a grain of salt, though, because, again, it\'s too big on purpose!Anyway, the fleece is decent quality, the construction of it is decent quality (which I expect from Hanes!), and it\'s well-built for an inexpensive sweatshirt.'),
(30, 'Ordered this sweatshirt specifically because it was 50/50 and not 100% cotton. I was using it to iron on a vinyl image. I ordered a size large and a size small in the same color. I just washed both sweatshirts and they are both now the same size. I took a look at the tag and the size large is not the 50/50 as advertised but is 100% cotton and has 100% shrunk. Super disappointed.'),
(31, 'Yeah, if this is medium weight, the ones I get at Walmart must be super winter weight. Pretty darn thin material -- not the pull-over hoodie I remember wearing as a kid. It might be good on those coolish spring and fall days, but you\'ll be using this under a heavy jacket when the weather turns.'),
(32, 'Love this hoodie. Color is perfect and it\'s super comfy. Only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because the thread on my left sleeve came undone within the 1st hour of wearing it ):'),
(33, 'I bought a 2XL and I\'m 5\'6 and 200 pounds. For women around this height and weight, definitely buy a 2XL, you won\'t regret it. Also,  the sweater is an incredible value for just under $11.00! If you live in TX like me, this is probably all you will need for most of the year.'),
(34, 'This arrived smelling very strongly of vinegar so I didn\'t try it on until after I washed it. It may have shrunk a little bit after the wash.Somewhat smaller than I expected but then it stretched out a little bit and it\'s not a terrible fit. I wish it was a little longer on its own, but otherwise it\'s a pretty nice hoodie.The head hole is a bit tight to squeeze my head through, but it doesn\'t choke me afterwards (not too tight around my neck).The black is a nice shade, and it\'s definitely warm. I\'ve been happy to have it on colder days, and walking the dog at night. Anybody looking to pick one up, I\'d probably go for a size or two larger than your usual in case of shrinkage.'),
(35, 'This is the medium weight hoody I\'ve been looking for. I have been wearing one for weeks and had to come back for a few more. I now have 3 colors. Ok I could even want a few more as gifts.Its not the heaviest hoody I own, but the heaviest is more like a pullover coat. These hoodies are warm and comfortable for everyday anywhere wear.Classic pullover all the way: These have the full pass-through pocket, tipped drawstring, drawstring eyelets, and elastic cuffs and wasteband.* They are perfectly soft with quality construction.* The neckline is not at all constricting.* material is comfortable, warm, and easy to wash* NO TAGS not even obvious branding anywhere you can see itBuy multiples and be sure to check alternate colors for extra savings!'),
(36, 'Comfy sweater for $10 bucks. Bought a medium and it fit exactly how I wanted it to fit. I\'m 5\'8 and About 130 lbs.'),
(37, 'What a difference a year makes.  The last time I bought one of these, in fact, five of these, they were terrific for cuddling up against the chilly winter nights.  I loved, even adored them  I gave them away to friends.  They were just perfect.  I can\'t believe what I got with this one.  The material was far from heavy.  I have to wear a sweater with it for it to provide the warmth that my last year\'s did.  I\'m just glad I got to see this one before gifting any more to friends.  Hanes is such an iconic brand, known for quality.  I hope they will reconsider the changes they have made.  I realize costs go up and companies need to make profits, but I\'d rather pay a dollar or two more than get this poor quality hoodie.  The upshot is that I was really planning on giving these to friends for Christmas.  Of course, I now will not.  So by lowering the quality, they have lost future sales from me.'),
(38, 'Love love love this sweater! It is a little thin but it’s great for the price! I want to get more in different colors! I got the XL and fits great, I’m usually XL'),
(39, 'This sweatshirt isn\'t very soft and its very small. I usually wear a small in men\'s shirts/sweatshirts but went up to a medium just to be safe and it is still snug. No biggie, I\'ll just return it and order a large.....Nope. Turns out there are no returns. Which I don\'t understand because its shipped sold through Amazon.com. Definitely order up cause you\'ll be stuck with it.'),
(40, 'I\'m a 5\'10\' 200lb woman. I bought a 3XL so I could have something comfy to live in around the house during the winter months. I was expecting it to be a little longer... It covers my bum but just barely. It\'s also thinner than a typical hoody that\'s okay because I get hot easily. Overall I\'m pleased with this product, it will definitely serve its purpose.'),
(41, 'First of all, I love this. If you’re looking to buy this to sleep in it’s perfect, comfortable as heck, super soft and perfect for cuddling in.If you are getting this to workout in, go a size smaller than you normally do. If you don’t, it won’t hit your shoulders properly as this is slightly baggy. Also, if you’re wearing this in cold environments, know that it’s super super thin (like 3 TShirts thin (this was a horrible metric lol, but know it’s not like a standard sweatshirt)).All in all, I love this and I did purchase another one in a second color. This is the perfect cheap hoody.I will update my review once I’ve washed this or if my opinion changes in time. But for right now I love this.If you come across my review and I haven’t updated it within 3-4 weeks, know that it’s been washed and hasn’t had any problems. But like I said, I’ll probably be coming back to update my review. Definitely buy this, though. For 10 bucks you can’t really go wrong haha.Also, I am a male, athletic build, body building, 5’11 and 165lbs. My measurements for suit jacket is 40S.Now I feel I’ve provide too much info for such a review haha, but hopefully this helps someone.'),
(42, 'I like my clothes to fit loose with some extra room for comfort, and this sweatshirt is just perfect. I ordered 3xl, at first I thought it was going to arrive enormously big, but it fits fine. I can even say it runs a bit small to be a 3xl but still fits good. And good for the price too.I recommend ordering a size or two up. The size chart is correct, but the sweatshirt should shrink a size or two after several washes and dries.'),
(43, 'I bought this in a 4x men\'s because I love oversized hoodies, particularly in black and particularly because it helps to masquerade a black cervical collar I\'ve been wearing due to a neck injury. My only complaint is the size of the neck hole. If I were actually a larger man who wears a 4x, there\'d be no way I\'d ever be able to fit my head through that hole. Bigger hoodie, bigger neck hole. It isn\'t a difficult concept, and should have been a design consideration given the size. Otherwise, I like it, it\'s comfy, and it fits just the way I like my oversized clothing to fit.'),
(44, 'This hoodie has a really weird fit for an xl. I’m 6 1 tall and lanky, I usually order xl for the extra sleeve and torso length. The sleeves are long enough, they are just so tight around my wrist I can’t even push them up 2 inches up my forearm. Same with the collar, it was so tight it felt like it was choking me till I pulled on it a few times to loosen it. The torso is so short it goes down to JUST my waistline, yet is so wide at the bottom I could fit 2 of me in here. Honestly I hate it, I’ve never had a hoodie fit so horribly. Way too small in some places, way too big in another'),
(45, 'Great product. My teens say it’s thicker than their other sweatshirts. Warm. Order 1 size up! It shrinks 1 full size down after washing and drying. I kept it the first one I ordered which was a small and gave it my my teenage daughter as she wanted one.But had to order a large for my 15 year old son (who normally wears a men’s medium). For reference, he is 130 lbs and 5’11” with an athletic/runner’s build.It shrinks all over, not just in 1 area. But it does shrink proportionately, everything gets 1 size smaller. I did in fact dry mine in the dryer on medium heat, but who has time to let a sweatshirt air dry?'),
(46, 'My husband is a big guy who typically wears a 3x.  I went with the 4x just to make sure it was roomy enough.  Unfortunately, it\'s too short.  I wouldn\'t buy this item again.  If your guy is 6\'0\' or over, this will be too short on him if he\'s a bigger guy.'),
(47, 'Very cheap. It was too tight around the neck when I pulled on it it ripped around the neck. I bought a different hoodie the same size. I like the extra large should be much larger than this one. I would not buy this product again is too cheap and too small. It\'s off so not very soft or stretchy.'),
(48, 'Soft Inside, somewhat surprised It’s not as oversized as I expected, I got a 2XL I’m a women 5’3 145 and wanted It over sized and long, It’s how I wear em with my uggs In cold, I put It on and It fit at my waist and HOSTELY no lie fits like I bought a reg medium, I have 2XL In Big and tall and they fit long (that’s why I buy for that reason) I did notice price difference on picking XXXL was $21 XXL was $21 2XL was $14 yet If I buy a 5XL It’s only $16 odd to me, I’d buy from other place but don’t have baby pink, Well NOT TRASHING the QUALITY of the sweatshirt, GREAT MADE, I’m keep cus Hanes makes good, just sizing ?? To me,'),
(49, 'DENIM BLUE and Black colors are exactly as shown. I also ordered the Cardinal which is not as rich looking as the image, not even close. I ordered an XL because I prefer long sleeves and loose fitting hooded sweatshirts (the size Large I later ordered fits great). This XL fits much larger than I expected, but I have a feeling it will shrink in the dryer. I always wash clothes in cold water, so little chance of shrinkage with that.  A large would have been better, but I don’t mind. The blue color is gorgeous! The material is very soft. I live in Miami, so I do not need a really thick sweatshirt. This one is perfect for me. I ordered a black one, size 3X, for my nephew. He loves the fit because he wears really baggy clothing. He’s 5’ 7”, 214 pounds. I’m a girl, so I can’t tell you my size—sorry! I am 5’ 8” though.'),
(50, 'I got this product for a friend of mine for a Christmas present. He wanted a slightly oversized hoodie for lounging around in. After checking the reviews, I got a size large. (he is 5\'6 and 115 pounds)  Usually, I am rather skeptical about buying clothes online, but I figured that for the price and my time frame, I would try this out. The color is as pictured, (I personally bought the light grey model) and the fabric feels pleasant and is not cheaply made. There is a slight point at the top of the hood, so if you\'re getting a white one of these, beware. The inside of the hoodie is incredibly soft, quite honestly I was reluctant to give it away after feeling the inside, I loved it. He wears it very often and says that it handles well in the wash. The only complaint I would have about this product is the material is rather thin, meaning that you have to wear a shirt or something under it. But I definitely world recommend this item, and I will probably get one for myself in the near future.'),
(51, 'Where I live, medium-weight sweatshirts are perfect for Fall, Winter and early Spring. I wear them pretty much everywhere except work. This Hanes hooded sweatshirt is a good quality product - soft, just thick enough, and durable. They are priced well too. I do find that they run on the smaller side. I am 5\'8\' and about 170-175 lb. - in other words, shortish and stocky/broad. I usually take either a medium or large depending on the brand. In this style I am a solid large. A medium would probably be ok in length but would be too tight in the shoulders. So if you are of a bit of a heftier build like me, you may want to consider ordering up a size. Once I figured this out I was able to buy a few of these in a proper size. Overall: highly recommended!!'),
(52, 'Beware...They run small,what a waste of my time and money..I have a very busy lige.Full time job w 7 kids and dont have the time to hassle w returns..Ugh..i\'m so Dissatisfied,I am a True 2xl and this 2xl hoodie fits like a xl..Im 5\'10 248lbs I know now that a 3xl would fit perfect..smh..'),
(53, 'I ordered this as it was listed as a \'PULLOVER\' but when I opened the package it was a full length zipper hoodie that was sent instead. I double checked the description to insure that I placed my order correctly and I did. This is the first time I\'ve ordered a hoodie from Amazon for a Hanes Men\'s Pulloved EcoSmart Fleece Hooded Sweatshirt and didn\'t get the correct thing. I looked at other reviews and nobody was saying anything about this being an issue.  Only thing I can think of is the person who pulled the item from the stock read the number wrong or it was mislabeled within the warehouse. Needed the pullover as my daughter was going to put an orginal design on it.'),
(54, 'Soft, not too thick, and fit perfectly. The arms were a little long on me but not enough to be an issue.'),
(55, 'good shirt'),
(56, 'I use it thrice a week (and the other same exact product but in red color) when running both on the treadmill and outside on track after working out every day. It\'s comfortable and helps you sweat little more than without it on. I got a large and it fits (not too large or too small) I have a body that time by time change from medium to large and vice versa. It actually depends on the clothing materials and such though, but anyway.Great product.'),
(57, 'I bought this to work out in it\'s thick but not heavy thick so it\'s perfect I I wear an extra large but I need a size up in this hoodie if it\'s kind of tight or small my height is 6 2 my weight is 225 Good hoodie for the price'),
(58, 'Really love this hoodie! I found it to fit a bit smaller than what I expected for men’s size as I wanted a baggy hoodie to sleep in but it’s  well made & is really cozy! Can’t beat the price too! I bought 3 others-the first 2 in medium which are slightly big on me & the other 2 in large which are nice & roomy. Like I said though these run small for men’s sizes'),
(59, 'I love this hoodie so much. I am 5\'7\' and 200lbs (ugh baby weight), with a DD bra size. I ordered the 2xl size and probably should have ordered a size down. However, I love baggy hoodies. It is true to the color, I was worried the maroon would show up red or something. Smells a bit like vinegar at first, but nothing a wash couldn\'t get out. The hood itself is big enough to actually use, some women\'s hoods are not. It is soft on the inside. Seems durable so far. Would definitely buy this again, would promote as well if offered more ???'),
(60, 'It’s a bit thick, but that isn’t all bad. It keeps you warm, however the inside material is fuzzy and if I wear something black, the fuzz sticks to my shirt like lint. So if you want to wear this as a shirt/top only with nothing underneath, it’s great. Another thing is I usually wear hoodies baggy or just big in general. I’m a medium and got a large, and this fit me like a medium. It’s not too tight, but tighter than I like. It fits like a shirt with a shirt underneath, not like a hoodie should.'),
(61, 'I really love this hoody but there are a couple of things I was expecting but didn\'t get. I was expecting the hoody to fall a little lower than it does for the size I chose. If you look at the picture of the guy with the hoody on and his hand in pocket, that\'s how far it goes down. I thought if I got a bigger size it would be about mid thigh on me but the larger the size, the wider the hoody is made. So it\'s not made longer, just wider. I still love it though. The hood is a little small for my head. I like hoods to come just hitting the eyebrow and this one just fits on my head. The hoody is not totally thick either. It\'s like thin sweatpants material so it would be good for an extra layer under a Jean or biker jacket.Besides those things it\'s a great hoody and I plan to wear the heck out of it. Thanks Hanes!'),
(62, 'Not true to size!  I ordered a size larger to wear clothes underneath, was way smaller than other sweatshirts a size smaller by other companies.'),
(63, 'I really love this hoodie and i can\'t stop wearing it lol. It\'s fleece lined and i got it in the biggest size possible which is a 5x and it so big and baggy just like i wanted :o) when i boughy it i was trying to channel my inner arianna grande and it has turned into my favorite hoodie lol. The only thing I don\'t really like is the hood is has a pointed tip that makes me feel like a pikman or Maggie from the Simpson\'s when shes in her star coat. Other than that its pretty awesome for the price. Mine is a golden yellow which happens to be my second fave color which also helps me love it .'),
(64, 'I bought this for my daughter for her Frisk (Undertale) cosplay. She wore if once for the con and really hasn\'t taken it off since. It is large (we bought a larger size), fluffy, and warm with a very soft interior. It is a great shirt to just cuddle up in and watch TV. It would be perfect for a cold winter day as well. It appears to be of good quality and has withstood several washings now without really fading (we got the light blue one). Overall, we were pleased with the shirt and the fit. It was exactly what we were looking for.'),
(65, 'I love this green pullover so much I decided to order the pink. I am 5’1”and weigh 150 and ordered the mans large. I have experienced Clothes made from cotton that are washed like these pullovers will shrink so I Order’s at least a larger size up. The weight is perfect, not too thin or too thick. My daughter liked them so much she got the green and pink pullover.'),
(66, 'I had been seeking a black hoodie, something stylish and reasonable.I noticed that Hanes not only had what I was seeking but also with recycled materials! I am a green guy myself, so I made the purchase and did not regret it one bit. It fits really well and isn\'t too short around the neck area. I wear it whenever I can!5 Stars for comfort, affordability, and branding.'),
(67, 'I\'m 5\'9\' and 175lbs, and the Large is a good fit: not baggy, but comfortable. These are nice hoodies, very soft and a great selection of colors. However, they\'re a bit on the lightweight side -- they don\'t provide a ton of warmth. Still, at this price point -- under $12 -- you can\'t expect everything...'),
(68, 'Hanes makes amazing clothing and I\'ve purchased Hanes products for over 25 years. This one is great but runs smaller than the men\'s large zip up. I\'d purchased the zip up for one son in a size medium for my middle son who is lanky and tall; perfect fit. I owned a large men\'s zip up and kept it for myself when I got rid of the guy who wore it (I know, just go with it). My youngest picked this one out for himself and he didn\'t mean to get the pullover and when we received it, it was sure tiny for a large! So just be mindful if your recipient is a large and wants the pull over, get one size larger and it will be just fine. I\'ve never even had shrinkage with Haynes products so you\'ll be good to go. I\'d suggest drying on medium heat just to help this product last a good long time.'),
(69, 'This sweater, I would say is really good for the price you pay. I have owned it for about two months. One of the best things about this sweater is the fabric. The fabric is sturdy and the inside is pretty comfortable. Another thing that could be noted about the fabric is that unlike other sweaters in the same price range this sweater does not attract small lint balls. One of the biggest positives about this product. As for the actual fit. I would say it’s great. I sized up because I like sweaters to fit loose on me, but I imagine they fit just right even if you do not size up like I did. The sleeves are not too short, they end right at the wrist. The bottom of the sweater falls at the belt line. The one downside I really had with this sweater was the hoodie. It was a little bit too small, and was uncomfortable to wear whenever it would rain. It was too small and a bit uncomfortable around the neck. Overall this sweater is good, affordable, and durable. You get a nice product for a low price point. I have used it various times, and I would recommend buying this sweater if you were thinking about it.'),
(70, 'I’ve ordered this hoodie since it was a cheap option. I needed a red hoodie for a Halloween costume (DIY ladybug) so I did not expect great quality. I was pleasantly surprised. The sweatshirt is great. Soft and warm. I’ve washed it and it did not shrink or stretch. I ordered a medium. I’m 5.8 and it is a little bit baggy since it’s a male hoodie but I don’t mind. I will definitely wear it during fall and winter...'),
(71, ' 138 lb female'),
(72, 'I was really nervous about buying these because they\'re so inexpensive, I expected them to be thin and/or Asian sizing. However they are seriously the best hoodies I have, and I have some expensive ones! Really thick and soft, especially inside, they feel almost like fleece. Size is great, I bought a couple sizes up because I like hoodies oversized and I expected a bit of shrink in the wash. Tbh I forgot to try them on before so I\'m not sure how much they shrunk (if at all), but either way I\'m happy with the fit. My only complaint about the size is they\'re pretty boxy and personally I prefer longer and narrower rather than just wider, but they still fit fine. Colors are true to the pictures. Very pleased, will probably pick up more!'),
(73, 'Felt great, especially for the price, however.... the hole for your head.... it was so small my neck barely fit it, I felt like I was part of a mitch hedberg joke and being chokedSadly I\'ll have to return it.  It also ran very short, I normally order hoodies a size larger so they\'re not only longer but when they get washed they dont shrink too much, not possible with this one, it\'s more of a crop top'),
(74, 'Besides arriving promptly and offered at a fair price (about the same as a single T Shirt), they fit just right, put together nicely and looked great.They are just a bit light weight, but not flimsy. Great for layering and not so heavy that you dare not get them wet. The sleeves have a nice long length, the hem fit nice and firm against your hips, not open and airy like a skirt. The hood is a nice full size, without feeling obstructive.Overall this Hanes Sweatshirt is simply a standard of what you would expect in clothing.'),
(75, 'So I only actually bought this online because I couldn\'t find a green hoodie that wasn\'t a zip-up anywhere near me. I tend to break zippers because I wear my jackets literally to death, so zippers was a deal breaker. Believe it or not, Amazon was the only place where a decent lightweight hoodie was available in dark green.In the end, I was super happy with this purchase. Ibought a size up because I wanted it to be really baggy and got exactly what I expected. The fabric is really sturdy but not overly heavy. It was a little stiff right out of the package, but a run through the washing machine fixed that and left the interior soft and fuzzy.Be aware that it does shrink a bit in the wash, so if you didn\'t buy it a size up, you\'ll need to stretch the fabric a bit to wear it in.This is something I would seriously recommend, buy again, and get someone as a gift.'),
(76, 'OMG!! My favorite thing in my closet. I bought two in two different colors and if I could live in them I would. They are so soft nice and thick for this MD weather just everything I love in my comfy clothes. Must buy you wont regret it!!! I did buy them a size bigger that\'s how I like my comfy clothes baggy'),
(77, 'Perfect fit, I\'m 5\'3 115 lbs anf I got a small. Was worried it would be too small bc I like mine a little baggy but it\'s perfect. Bought these to wear under my Carhartt vests this fall/winter. Will be ordering more!'),
(78, 'Very pleased with this purchase Pullover fits as expected. Pullover is made with quality and and will keep the wearer warm on cold days. Good and drawstrings are made the with thick strings and long enough not to be be pulled into the hood. The Pullover arrived sooner than expected and was well packaged. Will order again when another Pullover is ever needed in the future!'),
(79, 'This product is amazing it is a little tight around the waste initially but don\'t worry that\'ll go away in a few minutes just stretch it out and it won\'t come back and it\'ll still be stretchy, it just won\'t feel as strong as initially.  I ordered a small and I\'m 5\'7 with a muscular build and it left plenty of space for my chest and arms. On top of a great fit it looks awesome, I\'m a big no branded clothing guy and it is super soft and comfy inside. All in all you\'ll be warm comfy and looking good. Cannot do better for the price 10/10 would recommend.'),
(80, 'Bought this for my daughter. She wore it without washing first and now we are in urgent care because she had an allergic material to whatever chemicals they used on this thing. She’s completely covered from head to toe in a painful, itchy rash. Buyer beware'),
(81, 'I\'ve bought three of these pullovers now and they are perfect for the price.  The only thing I will say is that after one wash, there is quite a bit of shrinkage, so you might be okay going up a size and let the washer shrink it to your fit.  To give an idea: I am 5\'7 and 165 pounds and the medium fit perfectly right out of the bag.  After one wash, it fits much more snug now until I wear a few times to loosen it up a little.  Definitely 100% happy with my purchase, though, but the shrinkage is something to consider.'),
(82, 'This is great. Its soft and comfy like any sweatshirt. I got the bright gold and was afraid it would be too intense, and although plenty of people say things like they need sunglasses to look at me, I also get loads of compliments. I\'m very small and petite, but got a medium so it\'d be comfy and big and its perfect. It also washes well in cold water, and I line dry.'),
(83, 'Sweatshirt runs small. Seems to be of good fabric though. I normally wear a large hoodie in Under Armour, Adidas and XL in Nike, but this didn’t fit at all. Gave it to my wife who is 5’3” and 120lbs and it fit her pretty good (a little baggy.) I’m 5’11” and 200lbs for reference.'),
(84, 'If you order a size that doesn\'t fit right,  there are NO REFUNDS nor exchanges for this item. DO NOT ORDER unless you are 100% positive that you have the correct size, which may or may not be accurate!'),
(85, 'this is the *big epic*i got a large and it was amazingim really small but i love having huge hoodies that cover my handsnot just the wrist,like my whole hand or just enough where my fingers are poking outand i got a hair tie and wrapped the excess in a little pony tail on the side of my hoodieand yeah the hoodie is thin :/but aside from it being likere a l l y thinits still enough to make me go like*ayy*this has passed the vibe check'),
(86, 'Super nice hoodie, I\'m 5\'10\'/120lbs. A medium fits perfectly.'),
(87, 'Somewhat small.  I\'m 5\'2, 140 lbs and I got a medium and fits kinda tight.  Also, it\'s tight around bottom of it which I don\'t like.  I gave this to a friend.  I\'d recommend getting a size bigger.'),
(88, 'I have ordered 3 of these (on different occasions) Only 4 stars because their sizing seems to be off.The first was an x-large. And I can wear the x-large,  but it felt tight.I usually wear a large to x-large in shirts and coats.The other two I ordered in 2x to get a little extra room from the x-large. (I prefer mine to be roomier but not overly baggie)The quality is good, like the materiel, (soft and tag-less) I do plan on purchasing more.  My advice,  if you prefer a little more room, up size'),
(89, 'This is a very lightweight hoodie - size runs small so go the next size up from your normal size. Not worth trouble to return but I am right where I started - in need of a hoodie as this is not what I wanted.'),
(90, 'Wanted an oversized hoodie for night time and running errands.....this is perfect! Perfect fit, perfect price, perfect color!'),
(91, 'Fits little small wish the material was thinking for being a hoodie feels like wearing 2 tee shirts. Biggest complaint was delivery they said 2 day delivery didn’t get the package till the 3rd day at 9pm kept and eye on it package said it was handed to customer. Defiantly wasn’t handed to me. Plus being delivered at 9pm left on front porch package could’ve got stolen these day. He didn’t even ring the door bell I have dogs and they are my alarm. It was delivered amazon'),
(92, 'I normally wear a 2x but ordered a 4x as I wanted a loose sweater. I\'m glad I did order larger because it fits the way a 2x would. It\'s comfortable for the most part but I had to modify the neck line a little as I found it a bit too tight and was very uncomfortable with that part. however after cutting a small notch between the pull strings it is much better. The other issue I have is with the sleeves, the cuffs are very long and do not stretch much so they felt a bit awkward at first. Overall it\'s a decent, warm sweater but I can bring myself to give more than 3 stars to something that doesn\'t fit the way it should and that I have to modify in order to wear comfortably. Just make sure if you do order, get a few sizes larger than you actually need.'),
(93, 'I bought this as a cheap sweatshirt to put a patch on and make cute, and it was perfect for that and saved me some money. I am 5\'3\' and 115 lbs and I ordered a small. For my preferred fit, it was a little small. I typically like my sweatshirts to be a little baggy and long enough to wear with leggings. Knowing how it fits, I would order a medium. The small fits, it is just a bit more snug than I would like. Hope this helps!'),
(94, 'The sizing is off.  I ordered an XL and it fits like a large.  The fabric is also thin so It\'s a good sweater for being around the house but not for a chilly fall day. If I get a one good year with out wearing out the fabric, I would be pleasantly surprised.  But overall it\'s ok for the price or for screening designs.'),
(95, 'Feels great.  The Sweater is not thick but it’s made of fleece.  I wear a size XL T-shirt and my other pull overs are XXL and they fit great and are big and loose.  This XXL Hoodie was still a bit small compared to the other ones so get a 3X. (XXXL) for big comfy sweaters.  Think of this fit as a undershirt where a XL wil Fit you but be a bit snug compared to a regular T-Shirt.'),
(96, 'Not comfy. Has shiney-ish material and the elastic on the bottom is non-existent. The inner fleece is cheap quality. Spend $20 and get a better value elsewhere.'),
(97, 'I was replacing my favorite sweatshirt purchased while vacationing at Topsail Beach, NC. It had to be cut off after a badly broken wrist. The label listed it as Hanes ComfortBlend and I was so happy to find it here. (Sadly there is no \'Topsail Beach\' lettering on the front - but we can\'t have everything.) ;) It\'s lightweight and very comfortable. A medium fits right for layering two thin shirts in winter. I\'m 5\'3\' - 110 lbs.'),
(98, 'I LOVE THIS HOODIE.. I love wearing oversized clothing and this is so comfortable. I was able to wear it without having to bundle up in the winter. I personally hate wearing multiple layers in the winter, and with this I was able to be comfortable and warm without the added layers. The color is also amazing. I ordered a size medium which fits me as a women\'s XL which is what I was going for.'),
(99, 'My 14-year old daughter got this in denim. She\'s about 5\'4\' and 100 pounds and the Small is perfect.  A little big, like a hoodie should be, and she LOVES it. Wears it almost every day! Says it\'s soft and she feels all cuddly in it. She has asked to order another in a different color. Would definitely recommend for the price!');
